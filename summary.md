au cours de la seconde moitié du xx e siècle le vaccin est un médicament qui la particularité de s'adresser à des sujets bien portants les principes actifs qui le composent sont issus d'organismes vivants et se différencient de ceux de la chimie classique par leurs structures moléculaires souvent complexes et parfois mal identifiées les propriétés de la préparation vaccinale dépendent étroitement du procédé de production mis en oeuvre et il est commun d'admettre que « le procédé fait le produit » la fabrication s'effectue en zones confinées due aux caractères pathogènes de la plupart des microorganismes impliqués les matières premières sont soumises à des contrôles rigoureux afin de garantir l'intégrité des produits vis-à-vis de contaminants viraux ou d'agents transmissibles non conventionnels comme le prion l'industrie du vaccin est caractérisée par la longueur des cycles de production la complexité des produits implique celle des contrôles qualité dont l'activité représente en moyenne 75 de la durée du cycle total de fabrication en tant qu'élément majeur de santé publique le monde du vaccin est soumis à des à-coups de production en fonction de la demande extérieure en particulier dans les contextes d'épidémie ou de menaces de bioterrorisme en parallèle l'industrie du vaccin doit intégrer les exigences toujours plus pressantes des autorités de santé le développement spectaculaire des départements assurance qualité et contrôle qualité ces quinze dernières années témoignent de cette évolution © 2009 elsevier masson sas tous droits réservés.le principe de la vaccination est d'induire chez l'individu sain la mémoire de plusieurs rencontres avec un agent infectieux en effet pour obtenir un niveau d'anticorps spécifiques capable de protéger l'individu la vaccination demande généralement plusieurs injections suivies de rappels.les premières approches d'immunisation remontent au vii e siècle où l'on reporte que des indiens bouddhistes ingéraient du venin de serpent pour se protéger des suites de morsures éventuelles 1 c'est au cours du xviii e siècle que les premiers bienfaits de la vaccination seront rapportés à travers les pratiques de « variolisation » déjà développées en inde et en chine puis introduites en angleterre par lady mary wortley montagu à son retour de turquie en 1721.", "visant à qualifier un vaccin contre les rotavirus ont nécessité le recrutement de 70 000 enfants pour un coût de 150 millions de dollars sur cette seule étude.se rajoute aux coûts d'études cliniques la prise en compte de l'unité de production englobant outre le bâtiment lui-même ses équipements ses utilités et toutes les procédures de qualification et de validation qui doivent se conformer aux exigences des bonnes pratiques de fabrication cgmp pour les états-unis à noter que l'europe et l'oms disposent aussi de gmp qui ne sont pas strictement identiques ni entre elles ni avec celles de la fda.il faut prévoir un montant compris entre 100 et 200 millions pour la mise à disposition d'un bâtiment validé et fonctionnel et une durée de quatre à six ans depuis l'avant projet jusqu à la mise sur le marché des premières doses.les progrès de la biologie moléculaire ont donné naissance à de nouveaux types de vaccins dont l'antigène n'est plus produit par l'organisme pathogène les exemples du vaccin hépatite b exprimé dans les cellules cho ou dans la levure de boulangerie ou plus récemment celui de l'antigène du papillomavirus exprimé dans la levure ou dans des cellules d'insecte témoignent du souci d'isoler et purifier le principe actif conduisant à des vaccins mieux caractérisés et mieux tolérés.la capacité de certains virus à induire une forte réponse immunitaire est mise à profit pour leur faire exprimer des protéines étrangères c'est l'exemple du vaccin contre la dengue qui est en cours de développement et dont les antigènes sont exprimés par le virus de la fièvre jaune ou l'exemple de la famille des poxviridae utilisant un poxvirus du canari pour exprimer des protéines hétérologues vih par exemple .le vaccin idéal vise à protéger contre le plus grand nombre de maladies en une seule injection qui soit la moins douloureuse possible et ne présente aucun effet indésirable toute une série d'initiatives visent à se rapprocher de cet objectif mise sur le marché de vaccins combinés formes plus purifiées et réduites à la molécule du principe actif développement de nouvelles techniques d'administration vaccinales pour remplacer l'aiguille systèmes de patch .le besoin de sécurité imposé par les agences vise à obtenir un produit mieux caractérisé fabriqué à partir d'un procédé parfaitement maîtrisé et documenté pour cela des outils de caractérisation aussi résolutifs que la résonance magnétique nucléaire rmn sont devenus des éléments courants pour appuyer le développement de nouveaux vaccins ou pour argumenter la biocomparabilité entre deux produits ayant subi des changements de procédés de production d'autres pratiques continuent à se déployer comme l'utilisation de contenants et même de bioréacteurs à usage unique afin de répondre aux préoccupations traditionnelles liées à la validation du nettoyage.l'amélioration des sondes et des capteurs couplée à des outils informatiques plus performants permettent l'acquisition des données mais aussi le contrôle et la modélisation du procédé avec l'espoir à long terme d'évaluer la conformité du produit en se basant sur l'acquisition exhaustive des données de culture en ligne process analytical technology 9 .de par ses spécificités l'accès au marché du vaccin n'est pas simple et fait réfléchir un grand nombre de sociétés face à l'investissement financier au temps de mise en route demandé et aux contraintes réglementaires toujours plus présentes au contraire des produits de la pharmacie traditionnelle le vaccin n'est pas dans la tourmente des produits génériques sa fabrication nécessite un large savoir-faire le procédé fait le produit et il est indispensable de posséder les bonnes lignées cellulaires et les isolats viraux ou bactériens prélevés initialement sur des échantillons humains.après les formidables progrès réalisés au cours des deux siècles passés la mise à l'échelle industrielle de la production de vaccins permet de sauver chaque année plus de trois millions de vies humaines 5 les pays industrialisés ont bénéficié avant tout de ces progrès et ont vu disparaître progressivement des affections comme la rage le tétanos la diphtérie ou la polio pour n'en citer que quelques-unes.cela ne doit pas nous faire oublier qu'il reste encore de nombreux défis à relever dans les années à venir les grands groupes pharmaceutiques investissent pour soutenir un doublement de leur capacité de production d'ici 2012-2015 et doivent s'aligner continuellement sur les recommandations de l'oms pour participer aux campagnes de vaccination en liaison avec les autorités de santé et les experts l'arrivée de groupes tel que global alliance vaccines immunization gavi largement financé par la fondation bill et melinda gates apporte des sources de financement importantes 750 millions de dollars en 2005 pour permettre la vaccination des enfants dans les pays les plus démunis et pour investir dans la recherche de vaccins contre les maladies tropicales dengue paludisme 10 ces financements constituent un moteur important dans les stratégies de recherches des grandes compagnies pharmaceutiques des résultats significatifs d'une telle approche ont déjà été obtenus dans la lutte contre la fièvre jaune en afrique les pays industrialisés sous l'égide de l'oms apportent également un soutien important pour permettre le transfert de technologie pour la production du vaccin grippe afin de se préparer à la lutte contre une éventuelle pandémie 11 les informations publiées par l'industrie pharmaceutique ces derniers mois révèlent des progrès spectaculaires dans la production de ce vaccin grâce à l'emploi de nouveaux adjuvants qui permettent une augmentation de capacité d'un facteur 6.beaucoup de pays d'asie ont fait d'immenses progrès et sont devenus des producteurs importants non seulement locaux mais également internationaux après l'obtention de la certification de l'oms label qui garanti la qualité des produits répondants aux normes internationales publiées par cet organisme à titre d'exemple l'inde est devenue le principal producteur de vaccin contre la rougeole et un acteur majeur de la production des vaccins rentrant dans le programme élargi de vaccination la chine s'apprête à participer à cet effort de production pour son marché local et pour l'exportation notamment vis-à-vis d'un vaccin contre l'encéphalite japonaise,investigated risk
