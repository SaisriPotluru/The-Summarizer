industrielle connaît son essor au cours de la seconde moitié du xx e siècle le vaccin est un médicament qui la particularité de s'adresser à des sujets bien portants les principes actifs qui le composent sont issus d'organismes vivants et se différencient de ceux de la chimie classique par leurs structures moléculaires souvent complexes et parfois mal identifiées les propriétés de la préparation vaccinale dépendent étroitement du procédé de production mis en oeuvre et il est commun d'admettre que « le procédé fait le produit » la fabrication s'effectue en zones confinées due aux caractères pathogènes de la plupart des microorganismes impliqués les matières premières sont soumises à des contrôles rigoureux afin de garantir l'intégrité des produits vis-à-vis de contaminants viraux ou d'agents transmissibles non conventionnels comme le prion l'industrie du vaccin est caractérisée par la longueur des cycles de production la complexité des produits implique celle des contrôles qualité dont l'activité représente en moyenne 75 de la durée du cycle total de fabrication en tant qu'élément majeur de santé publique le monde du vaccin est soumis à des à-coups de production en fonction de la demande extérieure en particulier dans les contextes d'épidémie ou de menaces de bioterrorisme en parallèle l'industrie du vaccin doit intégrer les exigences toujours plus pressantes des autorités de santé le développement spectaculaire des départements assurance qualité et contrôle qualité ces quinze dernières années témoignent de cette évolution © 2009 elsevier masson sas tous droits réservés.le principe de la vaccination est d'induire chez l'individu sain la mémoire de plusieurs rencontres avec un agent infectieux en effet pour obtenir un niveau d'anticorps spécifiques capable de protéger l'individu la vaccination demande généralement plusieurs injections suivies de rappels.les premières approches d'immunisation remontent au vii e siècle où l'on reporte que des indiens bouddhistes ingéraient du venin de serpent pour se protéger des suites de morsures éventuelles 1 c'est au cours du xviii e siècle que les premiers bienfaits de la vaccination seront rapportés à travers les pratiques de « variolisation » déjà développées en inde et en chine puis introduites en angleterre par lady mary wortley montagu à son retour de turquie en 1721. à cette époque des extraits du virus de la variole préparés à partir de croûtes prélevées sur les malades étaient mis directement en contact avec les muqueuses du nez dans le de prévenir la maladie quelques temps plus tard les découvertes de benjamin jesty et edward jenner apporteront une nouvelle dimension à la prévention de la variole après avoir montré que le virus de la variole bovine pouvait protéger contre la forme humaine malgré des résultats encourageants le fait d'introduire à cette époque un agent étranger et pathogène dans un organisme sain restait une pratique mal acceptée voire choquante 1 .le siècle suivant sera celui de l'éclosion de la vaccinologie grâce aux importantes découvertes en microbiologie les agents pathogènes commencent à être isolés observés au microscope et surtout cultivés en bouillon de culture ou sur des tissus animaux ces progrès permettront la mise au point de vaccins dont l'un des plus célèbres est celui contre la rage.fort de ces retentissants premiers succès le besoin de développer la vaccination comme un véritable outil de santé publique se concrétisera au cours du xx e siècle la première moitié du siècle sera particulièrement féconde comme en témoignent les résultats sur la prévention de la tuberculose de la coqueluche ou de la fièvre jaune.les anatoxines diphtériques et tétaniques de ramon 1923-27 peuvent être considérées comme les premiers vaccins bactériens modernes 2 et auront des impacts remarquables en particulier dans la prévention du tétanos au cours de la seconde guerre mondiale suivra l'ère de la biologie industrielle à partir de 1950 grâce aux nouvelles techniques de cultures microbiennes et cellulaires qui permettront de produire des millions de doses dans de grands bioréacteurs parmi les nouveaux produits développés citera le vaccin antipolio ceux contre la rougeole les oreillons la varicelle et la mise sur le marché des premiers vaccins à base de polysaccharides bactériens purifiés suite aux travaux de gotschlich cité par rey et triau 2 ces derniers seront utilisés pour la prévention des infections à méningocoques et à pneumocoques le concept de vaccin conjugué qui consiste à coupler un polysaccharide à une protéine dite « porteuse » anatoxine tétanique ou diphtérique en général pour assurer une immunogénicité efficace chez le nourrisson permettra dans les années 1990 la mise sur le marché d'un vaccin contre les méningites à haemophilus les applications du génie génétique pour produire des protéines recombinantes profiteront aussi à l'industrie du vaccin avec la mise à disposition dans les années 1990 du vaccin contre l'hépatite b 3 exprimé sous forme de microparticules dans la levure de boulangerie ou dans les cellules mammifères chinese hamster ovary cho .notre siècle actuel permis l'enregistrement de plusieurs nouveaux vaccins conjugués contre les infections à pneumocoques et à méningocoques ainsi qu'un nouvel exemple de vaccin recombiné ciblé contre les affections à papillomavirus.l'avènement de la biotechnologie appuyée par le développement de l'informatique à partir des années 1980 permis de rendre les procédés encore plus performants plus sûrs et mieux compris l'industrie du vaccin bénéficié de ces progrès mais reste par essence une discipline à part dans l'univers pharmaceutique avec de nombreuses contraintes et particularités que nous allons développer tout au long de cet article.la première particularité et non des moindres est liée au fait que le vaccin est un médicament qui s'adresse en général à des sujets sains sauf cas particulier comme la rage après forte suspicion de contamination les maladies infectieuses comme le tétanos ou la rage conduisent presque toujours à la mort faute de traitements suffisamment efficaces et lié au fait que les processus sont irréversibles la seule façon d'éviter ces pertes humaines est donc de vacciner.un vaccin est un produit biologique contenant un ou plusieurs antigènes ils sont fabriqués soit à partir de bactéries ou de virus entiers soit à partir de leurs constituants protéines polysaccharides.. ou de leur produit de sécrétion dans le cas des toxines celles-ci sont inactivées par un traitement chimique formaldéhyde tout en préservant la capacité d'induire une réponse immunitaire à ce principe actif s'ajoutent suivant le type de vaccin deux classes de composants qui participent à la formulation du produit final l'adjuvant en charge de stimuler et d'orienter la réponse immunitaire et l'agent stabilisant chargé de maintenir les propriétés du produit sur une longue durée dans des conditions définies en particulier les agents stabilisants sont utilisés dans les formes de vaccins appelées multidoses destinées à injecter plusieurs fois le vaccin à partir du même flacon 4 .les vaccins sont généralement classés en vaccins vivants atténués vaccins inactivés vaccins à antigènes purifiés et vaccins recombinants 5 distingue aussi les vaccins monovalents vaccinant contre une seule maladie et les vaccins multivalents ou combinés vaccinant contre plusieurs maladies un vaccin monovalent contient souvent plusieurs antigènes comme pour la polio trois types ou la grippe saisonnière trois souches ou le pneumocoque avec 23 sérotypes.dans la préparation des vaccins vivants atténués la réduction du pouvoir pathogène est obtenue par passage du microorganisme sur des cultures cellulaires successives ou par voie chimique pasteur avait montré l'intérêt d'un tel procédé en diminuant progressivement la virulence du virus de la rage par passages répétés sur moelle épinière de lapin ce type de vaccin est très immunogène car le virus ayant gardé sa capacité à se multiplier vivo induit une réponse immunitaire très voisine de celle provoquée par l'infection naturelle mais il possède l'inconvénient de pouvoir retourner vers une forme sauvage actuellement un grand nombre de vaccins viraux sont fabriqués à partir de formes atténuées citons les vaccins contre les oreillons la rougeole la rubéole la polio par voir orale et la fièvre jaune.la préparation de vaccins inactivés ou tués s'obtient par exposition de l'agent pathogène à un traitement physique ou chimique entraînant une perte définitive de la virulence sans dénaturer son pouvoir immunogène les conditions de réalisation de l'inactivation chimique ou thermique et les contrôles associés doivent être d'une rigueur absolue pour garantir l'absence de germes vivants citons les exemples des vaccins contre la rage la coqueluche dite cellulaire ou à germe entier la grippe ou l'hépatite a.la mise au point de vaccins à antigène purifié consiste à isoler l'antigène de la cellule pour en obtenir une forme purifiée qui sera ensuite inactivée s'il s'agit de toxines les deux familles de molécules utilisées sont les protéines et les polysaccharides et dans certains cas le couplage chimique des deux vaccins conjugués les protéines sous forme brute peuvent être soit des toxines secrétées ou libérées dans le milieu de culture par autolyse cas des toxines diphtériques ou tétaniques soit des protéines recombinantes obtenues par génie génétique synthétisées dans une levure ou dans des cellules d'insectes vaccin hépatite b ou plus récemment vaccin contre infections à papillomavirus dans certains cas l'expression de ces antigènes donne lieu à une forme particulière de vaccins appelée virus-like particules vlp possédant des propriétés antigéniques très voisines du virus naturel 5 en comparaison aux germes entiers ces vaccins apportent une meilleure tolérance grâce à une forme plus purifiée mais du fait de leur niveau de pureté il nécessite l'emploi d'adjuvants les plus courants étant représentés par les sels d'alumine.la famille des polysaccharides concerne exclusivement les vaccins bactériens puisqu'ils sont purifiés à partir de bactéries capsulées apparaissent les vaccins contre les infections à méningocoques groupe c w et à pneumocoques notons que dans le cas de l'antigène vi de salmonella thyphi il s'agit d'un antigène k d'enveloppe et non d'un antigène capsulaire.la mise au point de formes conjuguées association polysaccharide-protéine porteuse permis le développement de vaccins pédiatriques à partir des années 1990 comme celui du vaccin act-hib ® sanofi pasteur dirigé contre les méningites à haemophilus du nourrisson 6 7 plus récemment d'autres vaccins conjugués ont été mis sur le marché français pour prévenir les infections à méningocoques et pneumocoques prevenar ® wyeth neisvac ® baxter meningitec ® wyeth menjugate ® kit novartis .une autre catégorie de préparations vaccinales consiste à associer plusieurs vaccins dans le même flacon ou la même ampoule afin de limiter le nombre d'injections la classe de ces vaccins combinés peut prévenir jusqu à six infections tétanos diphtérie polio coqueluche hépatite b méningite à haemophilus ces préparations sont compliquées à mettre en place et aussi à fabriquer mais ont un grand intérêt en pédiatrie et sont aussi très employées dans les rappels chez l'adulte. « le procédé fait le produit » maîtrise de la variabilité biologique le principe actif est issu d'organismes vivants et les producteurs ont la mission de délivrer un produit de qualité constante à partir d'outils biologiques et de matières premières exposées par essence à la variabilité.le premier paramètre à considérer est le microorganisme producteur qui subit des cycles de divisions plus ou moins éloignés des conditions naturelles initiales il est impératif de figer au plus tôt les propriétés industrielles qu'il possède car celles-ci ne sont pas immuables et peuvent être d. speck perdues si l'on prolonge les cycles de divisions au-delà d'un certain nombre pour assurer la conservation de ces propriétés les industriels fabriquent des lots de semence dont le principe est de préparer une suspension de cellules ou de virus à conserver puis de la répartir de façon homogène en ampoules la conservation des cellules sera assurée par lyophilisation ou par stockage à une température de −60 • c ou −135 • c en présence d'un cryoprotecteur chimique le plus employé étant le glycérol 8 afin d'assurer une disponibilité couvrant plusieurs dizaines d'années les lots de semence sont subdivisés d'une part en lots primaires qui représentent le stock référence de cellules de virus ou de bactéries et d'autre part en lots de travail dont chaque ampoule servira à initier un nouveau cycle de production.l'autre risque de variabilité concerne celui des matières premières utilisées dans le procédé de production en particulier celui entrant dans la composition des milieux de culture pour assurer la croissance du microorganisme après contrôle à réception chaque lot de matière première doit répondre à des spécifications précises avant d'être introduit dans un cycle de production les matières premières d'origine biologique tels que les hydrolysats de protéines d'origine animale ou végétale méritent particulièrement l'attention des producteurs car étant moins bien caractérisées du fait de leur complexité des différences entre lots peuvent apparaître et affecter le rendement du produit final pour minimiser ce risque la rédaction d'un cahier des charges la mise en place d'un contrat d'approvisionnement et l'organisation d'un audit qualité chez le fournisseur sont des pratiques incontournables.si la maîtrise de la qualité des matières premières est un prérequis tout aussi important est le choix du procédé et sa conduite pendant la fabrication les choix de la technologie vont conditionner l'efficacité du produit et son degré de pureté choix du microorganisme ou de la lignée cellulaire choix du mode et de la durée de culture choix du mode de récolte de l'antigène d'autres questions concernent les étapes de purification quels supports de chromatographie à utiliser pour le purifier quels stabilisants et quels adjuvants vont-ils entrer dans sa formulation finale la modification d'une étape du procédé si anodine qu'elle paraisse par exemple la modification de la durée de culture ou le remplacement d'une matière première peuvent avoir des impacts sur la qualité finale du produit et conduire par exemple à un polysaccharide de poids moléculaire différent risquant de ne plus posséder la même immunogénicité données personnelles .ainsi toute anomalie ou déviation du procédé décrit dans l'amm doivent être tracées et commentées et toute modification doit faire obligatoirement l'objet d'un dossier de variation qui comporte un argumentaire du changement pour certifier qu'elle ne remet pas en cause la qualité et la sécurité du produit si le changement introduit est estimé trop important nouvelle composition du milieu de culture nouvelle lignée cellulaire il peut être redemandé une étude clinique.les procédés doivent être aussi adaptés à des produits fragiles susceptibles de subir des dégradations si la chaîne du froid n'est pas respectée.du fait des propriétés infectieuses de la plupart des organismes impliqués dans la production les étapes de culture s'effectuent en zone confinée et en atmosphère contrôlée pour assurer un niveau d'empoussièrement et de biocontamination minimal le est à la fois de protéger l'environnement et d'assurer la protection des opérateurs ainsi que celle du produit en cours de fabrication le confinement primaire est assuré par les bioréacteurs et les postes de sécurités microbiologiques psm pendant les phases dites « ouvertes » .les bactéries et virus infectieux sont cultivés à grande échelle ce qui multiplie le risque de dissémination si les règles de confinement ne sont pas respectées il existe au niveau international un classement répertoriant chaque bactérie ou virus infectieux dans un niveau de confinement classé de deux à quatre la plupart des agents biologiques cultivés ne dépassent pas le niveau de confinement 2 mais ces dernières années ont vu l'émergence de certains virus qui ont nécessité des précautions particulières l'exemple du développement d'un vaccin contre le syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère sras dû à un coronavirus illustre bien ces propos une approche vaccinale été développée à marcy l'étoile dans les années 2002 et nécessité vis-à-vis des opérateurs et de l'environnement toute une série de mesures de protection individuelles et collectives qui étaient inhabituelles et parfois très contraignantes comme par exemple le port obligatoire d'une cagoule ventilée.la première démarche avant toute manipulation d'agents pathogènes à l'échelle pilote ou industrielle consiste à documenter leurs conditions de destruction après la phase de culture afin de garantir l'obtention d'un produit final sûr et pour permettre d'enchaîner les étapes suivantes du procédé en toute sécurité vis-à-vis des opérateurs.dans le cas de vaccins dits inactivés les conditions de cette inactivation doivent être parfaitement maîtrisées afin d'assurer la destruction de toute la population infectieuse sans affecter les propriétés immunologiques de l'antigène et sa stabilité les deux agents chimiques les plus utilisés sont le formaldéhyde plutôt utilisé dans les vaccins de type bactérien cas de la diphtérie et du tétanos et la bêtapropiolactone bpl plus spécifique des virus exemple de la rage 4 .la qualification des banques cellulaires ou des lots de semences virales/bactériennes nécessite une recherche exhaustive d'agents étrangers dénommés agents adventices cette contrainte est appelée communément sécurité virale.l'émergence d'autres agents transmissibles non conventionnels comme le prion engendré des initiatives particulières vis-à-vis des matières premières entrant dans le milieu de culture peptones animales sérum de veau ou utilisées ultérieurement dans la formulation comme agent protecteur gélatine albumine bovine une politique de substitution de toute matière première d'origine animale été menée dans un grand nombre de sociétés productrices de vaccins pendant la période de transition ou quand les changements souhaités n'ont pas pu aboutir techniquement un renforcement de la documentation sur l'origine des matières d'origine animale été déployé et mise en pratique par l'envoi d'un formulaire à tout fournisseur afin de documenter l'origine de celles-ci leur mode d'obtention et les autres composants entrant dans leur fabrication.en dehors de la fabrication proprement dite qui comprend les étapes de culture de purification de formulation de répartition et de conditionnement le produit subit un ensemble de contrôles qui représente en moyenne 75 du temps de cycle de fabrication d'autres étapes peuvent se rajouter suivant le type de vaccin tel que le processus d'inactivation suivi de la mise en quarantaine par exemple pour produire un lot de polio injectable il faut quatre semaines de montée cellulaire deux jours de multiplication virale puis deux jours de purification et 15 jours d'inactivation à ce stade le produit est mis en quarantaine et il faut deux à trois mois avant les résultats des contrôles pour sortir le lot de la production le temps de cycle d'un lot de production polio dure donc au moins six mois données industrielles .l'autre exemple concerne la production du vaccin contre l'haemophilus influenzae type b conjugué qui dure dix mois mais 90 de ce temps est alloué aux opérations de contrôles contre 10 pour la fabrication proprement dite.une fois le lot de vaccin libéré par le pharmacien responsable le véritable feu vert pour la commercialisation est donné par l'afssaps qui contrôle à nouveau chaque lot libéré par le site pharmaceutique au total le cheminement du lot s'étend de neuf à 20 mois suivant le type de vaccins le délai le plus court étant attribué au vaccin grippe saisonnier et le plus long concerne les vaccins combinés à cause de leur complexité de fabrication et des contraintes de libération que doit respecter chaque composant antigénique l'ensemble de ces opérations nécessite plus de 900 références de produits qui doivent toutes se conformer à des spécifications précises.la durée de développement d'un vaccin est estimée actuellement de dix à 15 ans pour un budget total moyen estimé à un milliard d'euros le développement clinique est particulièrement long notamment pour la phase 3 chargée de démontrer l'efficacité du vaccin à grande échelle sur plusieurs milliers ou dizaines de milliers de sujets certaines études récentes comme celles conduites par merck co. inc. visant à qualifier un vaccin contre les rotavirus ont nécessité le recrutement de 70 000 enfants pour un coût de 150 millions de dollars sur cette seule étude.se rajoute aux coûts d'études cliniques la prise en compte de l'unité de production englobant outre le bâtiment lui-même ses équipements ses utilités et toutes les procédures de qualification et de validation qui doivent se conformer aux exigences des bonnes pratiques de fabrication cgmp pour les états-unis à noter que l'europe et l'oms disposent aussi de gmp qui ne sont pas strictement identiques ni entre elles ni avec celles de la fda.il faut prévoir un montant compris entre 100 et 200 millions pour la mise à disposition d'un bâtiment validé et fonctionnel et une durée de quatre à six ans depuis l'avant projet jusqu à la mise sur le marché des premières doses.les progrès de la biologie moléculaire ont donné naissance à de nouveaux types de vaccins dont l'antigène n'est plus produit par l'organisme pathogène les exemples du vaccin hépatite b exprimé dans les cellules cho ou dans la levure de boulangerie ou plus récemment celui de l'antigène du papillomavirus exprimé dans la levure ou dans des cellules d'insecte témoignent du souci d'isoler et purifier le principe actif conduisant à des vaccins mieux caractérisés et mieux tolérés.la capacité de certains virus à induire une forte réponse immunitaire est mise à profit pour leur faire exprimer des protéines étrangères c'est l'exemple du vaccin contre la dengue qui est en cours de développement et dont les antigènes sont exprimés par le virus de la fièvre jaune ou l'exemple de la famille des poxviridae utilisant un poxvirus du canari pour exprimer des protéines hétérologues vih par exemple .le vaccin idéal vise à protéger contre le plus grand nombre de maladies en une seule injection qui soit la moins douloureuse possible et ne présente aucun effet indésirable toute une série d'initiatives visent à se rapprocher de cet objectif mise sur le marché de vaccins combinés formes plus purifiées et réduites à la molécule du principe actif développement de nouvelles techniques d'administration vaccinales pour remplacer l'aiguille systèmes de patch .le besoin de sécurité imposé par les agences vise à obtenir un produit mieux caractérisé fabriqué à partir d'un procédé parfaitement maîtrisé et documenté pour cela des outils de caractérisation aussi résolutifs que la résonance magnétique nucléaire rmn sont devenus des éléments courants pour appuyer le développement de nouveaux vaccins ou pour argumenter la biocomparabilité entre deux produits ayant subi des changements de procédés de production d'autres pratiques continuent à se déployer comme l'utilisation de contenants et même de bioréacteurs à usage unique afin de répondre aux préoccupations traditionnelles liées à la validation du nettoyage.l'amélioration des sondes et des capteurs couplée à des outils informatiques plus performants permettent l'acquisition des données mais aussi le contrôle et la modélisation du procédé avec l'espoir à long terme d'évaluer la conformité du produit en se basant sur l'acquisition exhaustive des données de culture en ligne process analytical technology 9 .de par ses spécificités l'accès au marché du vaccin n'est pas simple et fait réfléchir un grand nombre de sociétés face à l'investissement financier au temps de mise en route demandé et aux contraintes réglementaires toujours plus présentes au contraire des produits de la pharmacie traditionnelle le vaccin n'est pas dans la tourmente des produits génériques sa fabrication nécessite un large savoir-faire le procédé fait le produit et il est indispensable de posséder les bonnes lignées cellulaires et les isolats viraux ou bactériens prélevés initialement sur des échantillons humains.après les formidables progrès réalisés au cours des deux siècles passés la mise à l'échelle industrielle de la production de vaccins permet de sauver chaque année plus de trois millions de vies humaines 5 les pays industrialisés ont bénéficié avant tout de ces progrès et ont vu disparaître progressivement des affections comme la rage le tétanos la diphtérie ou la polio pour n'en citer que quelques-unes.cela ne doit pas nous faire oublier qu'il reste encore de nombreux défis à relever dans les années à venir les grands groupes pharmaceutiques investissent pour soutenir un doublement de leur capacité de production d'ici 2012-2015 et doivent s'aligner continuellement sur les recommandations de l'oms pour participer aux campagnes de vaccination en liaison avec les autorités de santé et les experts l'arrivée de groupes tel que global alliance vaccines immunization gavi largement financé par la fondation bill et melinda gates apporte des sources de financement importantes 750 millions de dollars en 2005 pour permettre la vaccination des enfants dans les pays les plus démunis et pour investir dans la recherche de vaccins contre les maladies tropicales dengue paludisme 10 ces financements constituent un moteur important dans les stratégies de recherches des grandes compagnies pharmaceutiques des résultats significatifs d'une telle approche ont déjà été obtenus dans la lutte contre la fièvre jaune en afrique les pays industrialisés sous l'égide de l'oms apportent également un soutien important pour permettre le transfert de technologie pour la production du vaccin grippe afin de se préparer à la lutte contre une éventuelle pandémie 11 les informations publiées par l'industrie pharmaceutique ces derniers mois révèlent des progrès spectaculaires dans la production de ce vaccin grâce à l'emploi de nouveaux adjuvants qui permettent une augmentation de capacité d'un facteur 6.beaucoup de pays d'asie ont fait d'immenses progrès et sont devenus des producteurs importants non seulement locaux mais également internationaux après l'obtention de la certification de l'oms label qui garanti la qualité des produits répondants aux normes internationales publiées par cet organisme à titre d'exemple l'inde est devenue le principal producteur de vaccin contre la rougeole et un acteur majeur de la production des vaccins rentrant dans le programme élargi de vaccination la chine s'apprête à participer à cet effort de production pour son marché local et pour l'exportation notamment vis-à-vis d'un vaccin contre l'encéphalite japonaise,investigated risk

peu de cas ont été décrits chez l'enfant 2 4 5 6 notamment chez le nourrisson où l'on ne retrouve pas à notre connaissance de cas documenté dans la littérature pourtant la fréquence de cette complication chez l'enfant ne semble pas anecdotique avec une prévalence de 30 4 la physiopathologie de ce désordre métabolique dans l'asthme reste discutée la responsabilité des ß2-mimétiques par hyperstimulation adrénergique est une hypothèse réaliste 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 et cet effet secondaire est le plus souvent méconnu et sous-estimé nous rapportons le cas d'une petite fille de 2 ans

thérapeutique de la crise d'asthme une petite fille de 2 ans été hospitalisée en réanimation pédiatrique pour un aag traité par oxygénothérapie à haut débit méthylprednisolone et salbutamol par voie intraveineuse elle présenté une acidose métabolique ph 7,29 avec hypocapnie 26 mmhg chute des bicarbonates 12 mmol/l trou anionique 20 mmol/l et augmentation des lactates 8 mmol/l la recherche d'une maladie métabolique sous-jacente été négative l'évolution été favorable avec amélioration spontanée de l'acidose lactique permettant la sortie de l'unité de réanimation après 72 heures l'origine d'une acidose lactique au cours de l'aag est multifactorielle bien que sa résolution soit spontanée il est essentiel de la reconnaître car elle peut modifier la symptomatologie respiratoire et conduire à une escalade thérapeutique inappropriée cette petite fille de 2 ans été hospitalisée en réanimation pédiatrique pour un aag elle était née prématurément à 32 semaines d'aménorrhée sa et avait été ventilée 24 h pour une maladie des membranes hyalines elle avait été hospitalisée par la suite à 4 reprises pour des bronchiolites à virus respiratoire syncytial vrs ses radiographies pulmonaires étaient alors normales son traitement de fond comportait de la fluticasone 50 mg par jour ses vaccins étaient à jour dans ses antécédents familiaux retenait un asthme allergique chez son frère âgé de 6 ans elle avait présenté 15 jours auparavant une exacerbation d'asthme mal contrôlée par la fluticasone 100 mg 2 fois par jour et du salbutamol inhalé 200 mg 3 fois par jour à son arrivée au service d'accueil des urgences pédiatriques elle présentait une polypnée à 44 cycles/min une tachycardie à 152 battements/min une hypoxémie saturation pulsée de l'hémoglobine en oxygène à 87 en air ambiant une toux spastique et des signes de lutte marqués à l'auscultation pulmonaire notait une diminution bilatérale des bruits respiratoires elle était apyrétique avec une hémodynamique conservée le traitement initial comporté une série de 3 nébulisations de 2,5 mg de salbutamol à 20 minutes d'intervalle et une prise orale de 2 mg/kg de prednisone en raison de la persistance de la symptomatologie par absence de réponse aux nébulisations elle été transférée dans le service de réanimation pédiatrique un traitement intraveineux iv par salbutamol 1 mg/kg/min alors été instauré en association avec 40 mg/kg de sulfate de magnésium et de la méthylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/12 h l'enfant été ventilée de façon non invasive par oxygénothérapie à haut débit le cliché thoracique révélé une distension sans atélectasie et l'échocardiographie était normale l'ionogramme sanguin était normal les bicarbonates étaient abaissés à 14 mmol/l et il existait une hyperglycémie à 12,8 mmol/l à la numération sanguine les leucocytes étaient à 21 giga/l dont 18 giga/l de polynucléaires neutrophiles l'hémoglobine à 13 g/dl et les plaquettes à 323 giga/l la protéine c réactive crp était à 10 mg/l la gazométrie capillaire révélé une acidose métabolique avec un ph à 7,29 et une hypocapnie à 26 mmhg le trou anionique était à 20 mmol/l et les lactates à 8 mmol/l au plan infectieux la recherche de virus respiratoires par réaction de polymérisation en chaîne pcr s'est avérée positive pour le bocavirus et le coronavirus en raison de l'âge de l'enfant et malgré un développement psychomoteur et un examen neurologique normaux un bilan complet à la recherche d'une maladie métabolique été effectué bilan hépatique ammoniémie chromatographie des acides aminés et organiques carnitines et profil des acylcarnitines sanguines et urinaires l'ensemble de ce bilan était normal l'acidose lactique s'était installée rapidement puisqu'elle était présente à l'admission en réanimation et s'était aggravée progressivement la thérapeutique initiale par salbutamol iv n pas été modifiée en raison de la symptomatologie spastique intense de l'enfant par la suite parallèlement à l'amélioration de la symptomatologie et donc à la diminution de la pression thérapeutique pu constater une amélioration rapide du ph en moins de 24 heures et une normalisation en moins de 12 heures après l'arrêt du salbutamol iv tableau la sortie de réanimation été autorisée à 72 heures.l'anomalie acido-basique la plus fréquemment rencontrée dans les crises d'asthme de l'enfant est l'alcalose respiratoire avec hypocapnie par hyperventilation lorsque la situation s'aggrave peut être confronté à une acidose respiratoire par hypoventilation et hypercapnie la constatation d'une acidose métabolique avec hypocapnie et baisse des bicarbonates doivent faire rechercher une acidose lactique 7 l'acide lactique est produit selon deux voies l'acidose lactique de type survient en cas d'hypoxie tissulaire l'hypoxie ou l'hypoperfusion tissulaire augmente la glycolyse anaérobie et l'oxydation terminale du pyruvate en lactate accroît le travail des muscles respiratoires 1 2 7 8 la production d'acide lactique de type serait la conséquence d'une inadéquation entre la quantité d'oxygène reçue et des besoins élevés 8 dans l'acidose lactique de type b des altérations du métabolisme cellulaire généreraient un flux accru de pyruvate en lactate ou une diminution du métabolisme des lactates en l'absence d'hypoxie ou d'hypoperfusion tissulaire 1 4 7 ce type d'acidose lactique peut être favorisé par une anomalie congénitale du métabolisme comme un déficit en pyruvatedéshydrogénase ou par une défaillance hépatique transitoire 1 4 7 8 il peut également être lié à une stimulation adrénergique excessive 1 4 7 l'hyperadrénergie dans l'asthme peut être d'origine endogène et exogène la détresse respiratoire et l'anxiété dans la crise d'asthme grave entraînent une stimulation sympathique d'origine neuro-endocrine 1 7 l'administration de doses importantes de ß2-agonistes inhalés ou intraveineux accentuerait cette stimulation adrénergique la survenue d'une acidose lactique dans l'aag bien connue chez l'adulte été peu relevée chez l'enfant alors que son incidence est certainement sous-estimée 4 il est essentiel d'en faire le diagnostic bien que cela ne semble pas avoir d'incidence pronostique contrairement aux adultes chez qui l'acidose lactique pourrait être un marqueur de gravité prédictif d'une insuffisance respiratoire sévère 1 2 l'acidose lactique survient généralement dans les premières heures suivant l'instauration du traitement 1 4 sa résolution est spontanée et relativement rapide à l'arrêt ou à la diminution de la thérapeutique 8 sa reconnaissance est donc utile au plan thérapeutique en effet la gestion d'une crise d'asthme dépend de la gravité de l'insuffisance respiratoire l'acidose métabolique majore les efforts respiratoires par hyperventilation compensatrice cette dernière peut être à tort interprétée comme une aggravation de l'obstruction bronchique et conduire à une escalade thérapeutique inappropriée avec augmentation des ß2-mimétiques voire intubation avec ventilation mécanique 4 7 alors qu'il serait plus approprié dans ce contexte de les diminuer une augmentation risque en effet d'aggraver l'acidose lactique qui elle même peut inhiber l'effet bronchodilatateur des ß2-mimétiques et occasionner des troubles ioniques graves néanmoins les bêta-mimétiques restent une thérapeutique très utile et il pourrait être inadéquat de les rejeter au prétexte de situations rares chez l'enfant l'asthme grave n'étant observé que chez une faible proportion de patients et les crises aiguës étant de plus en plus rares grâce à la qualité des traitements de fond la place du dosage des lactates dans l'aag reste donc à définir il faut savoir penser à l'acidose lactique devant l'apparition d'une dyspnée atypique ou son aggravation inexpliquée la persistance d'une acidose malgré une capnie normalisée doit également conduire à doser les lactates.l'aag prédispose à la survenue d'une acidose lactique d'origine multifactorielle chez l'enfant l'acidose lactique de type b par hyperstimulation adrénergique n'est certainement pas rare il faut savoir penser devant la persistance d'une acidose métabolique car même si elle n pas de conséquence sur le pronostic elle peut modifier la prise en charge et empêcher une escalade thérapeutique inappropriée.les auteurs déclarent ne pas avoir de conflits d'intérêts en relation avec cet

l'inflammation allergique propre l'asthme peut aggraver l'obstruction et l'hyperr6ac-tivit6 bronchiques des asthmatiques en outre les infections virales respiratoires peuvent amplifier la r6action allergique bronchique induite par inhalation d'un allerg6ne et favoriser l'6closion d'un asthme ou d'un 6tat d'atopie certains virus peuvent induire la synth6se d'ige sp6cifiques et une r6ponse

via local allergic inflammation expression icam1 desquamation mucosa mucostasis etc and/or antiinflammatory effects histamine i1 existe de toute 6vidence des relations r6ciproques entre infection virale des voies respiratoires asthme et atopie les infections virales respiratoires peuvent aggraver ou d6clencher une attaque d'asthme voire induire la maladie ou un 6tat d'atopie r6ciproquement l'asthme et l'atopie pr6disposent aux infections de l'organe de choc c'est-g-dire si~ge de la r6action allergique.dans ce travail nous aborderons successivement quatre points importants de ces interactions g savoir 1 les arguments principalement les infections virales des voies respiratoires sont frequentes surtout chez l'enfant et elles surviennent generalement selon un mode saisonnier les principaux virus responsables sont les rhinovirus rv les coronavirus cv le virus syncytial respiratoire vsr les parainfluenza pi les influenza et les adenovirus av .les infections/~ vsr sont la cause principale de bronchiolite de l'enfant i1 s'agit d'une maladie grave touchant surtout les jeunes enfants avant 2 ans et comportant des sympt6mes d'obstruction bronchique se continuant souvent par des acces de bronchoconstriction et 6ventuellement d'asthme 4 12 la prevalence de l'asthme serait de 23 p. cent chez des enfants de 3 ans ayant eu precedemment une bronchiolite g vsr contre seulement 1 p. cent chez des contr61es apparies 17 de meme l'allergie alimentaire ou aux pneu-mallerg6nes diagnostiquae par tests cutanes et dosage d'ige specifiques serait significativement plus frequente chez les enfants ayant souffert de bronchiolite.une association entre infection virale respiratoire et attaque d'asthme est suspectee depuis des decennies car les asthmatiques ont souvent une histoire de rhume ou de toute autre infection respiratoire dans les jours precedant la crise les etudes 6pidemiologiques visant fl confirmer cette association avaient cependant jusqu'fl maintenant 6t6 peu concluantes en raison d'un taux relativement faible de detection virale 13 le r61e majeur des virus respiratoires dans le declenchement des crises d'asthme de l'enfant de 9/~ 11 ans 6t6 recemment confirm6 par johnston et al 11 qui utiliserent la polymerase chain reaction pcr afin d'augmenter la sensibilit6 de la technique de detection virale chez 114 ecoliers suivis pendant 12 mois ces auteurs ont note une relation temporelle entre une infection virale respiratoire demontree par pcr immunofluorescence ou culture sur des aspirats naso-pharyngiaux et serologie dans environ 80 p. cent des cas d'exacerbation asthmatique les rv furent de loin les virus les plus frequemment isolds suivis par les cv pi et vrs le r61e dominant des rv dans le ddclenchement des attaques d'asthme pourrait 6tre explique par la forte prevalence de ces infections dans la population gdndrale et par le fait que la molecule d'adhdsion icam-1 rdcepteur naturel pour les rhinovirus 8 est exprimee sur les cellules de la muqueuse respiratoire au cours de l'inflammation allergique.les infections virales respiratoires surtout fl rv eta vsr chez le tout jeune enfant sont donc une cause importante d'attaque d'asthme chez l'enfant et l'adulte i1 est 6galement possible que certaines infections respiratoires virales puissent etre le point de depart d'un asthme bien qu'il existe certaines publications relatant l'apparition d'asthme directement apres ou dans les suites d'une infection respiratoire la validit6 de cette association n'est pas encore prouvee cependant |es infections g vsr de la petite enfance sont un facteur de risque important pour le developpement ulterieur d'un asthme et d'une sensibilisation rdaginique.les mdcanismes expliquant l'action asthmogbne des virus restent mal connus en depit de recherches intensives sait que les infections naturelles ou experimentales par les virus parainfluenza et influenza peuvent provoquer chez l'homme des sympt6mes respiratoires toux expectoration bronchospasme une augmentation des resistances des petites voies aeriennes et une hyperreactivit6 bronchique qui peut persister plusieurs semaines apres l'infection.la majorit6 des virus respiratoires parainfluenza infuenza addnovirus vsr etc peuvent infecter les voies adriennes basses et induire une inflammation comportant un effet cytopathique pour l'epithdlium respiratoire la production de cytokines ill il6 ils ifnalpha et beta rantes gm-csf etc d'origine 6pithdliale la liberation de mediateurs proinflammatoires kinines et induire la synthese locale d'ige si l'infection des voies respiratoires hautes ne peut se transmettre aux bronches ou aux bronchioles comme le croyait jadis pour les rhinovirus doit alors penser fl des mecanismes indirects tels que bronchoconstriction reflexe ou alterations immunologiques systdmiques qui affecteraient secondairement le poumon les rhinovirus sont nous l'avons vu une cause frequente d'exacerbation asthmatique et leur cible privilegide est l'6pithdlium des losses nasales l'heure actuelle cependant il semble bien etabli que certaines especes de rhinovirus au moins puissent infecter les voles aeriennes peripheriques 18 comme les autres virus respiratoires les rhinovirus peuvent induire en effet des sympt6mes d'irritation et de l'hyper-reactivit6 bronchiques recemment il ere demontrd grfice/~ des biopsies nasales et bronchiques eta des lavages bronchoalvdolaires chez des volontaires infectes experimentalement par le rv16 une inflammation des bronches chez le sujet normal et atopique caract4ris6e principalement par une augmentation des lymphocytes suppresseurs tcd8 surtout et des 6osinophites activ6s i1 est int6ressant de constater que chez les atopiques seulement cette dernihre anomalie pouvait persister plusieurs semaines aprhs l'infection 5 .on peut ~t l'heure actuelle proposer 4 m4canismes pour expliquer faction asthmog6ne des virus respiratoires r6duire l'inactivation des tachykinines par les endopeptidases et par le biais de la mise nu des fibres vagales aff6rentes augmenter le tonus cholinergique des bronches et favoriser les r4flexes bronchoconstricteurs l'hyperrdactivit6 bronchique des asthmatiques pourrait 6galement r4sulter d'une inactivation par les virus des rdcepteurs muscariniques g2 des fibres nerveuses postganglionnaires d'une diminution des r4cepteurs ~-adr4nergiques ou de la lib6ration de m4diateurs bronchoconstricteurs .certains virus tout comme les allerghnes et les a6ropolluants peuvent provoquer une inflammation de la muqueuse respiratoire comportant un effet cytopathique pour l'4pith61ium et la s6cr6tion de cytokines et de m6diateurs proinflammatoires augmentant la perm4abilit6 des capillaires et favorisant ta migration des cellules inflammatoires i1 pourra en r4sulter un certain degr6 d'obstruction bronchique par desquamation de la muqueuse augmentation de la production de mucus mucostase diminution de t'activit6 ciliaire diap4d6se leucocytaire et 0ed6me cette inflammation des voies a4riennes s'ajoutant h l'inflammation allergique propre ~t l'asthme pourrait par un simple ph6nombne additif expliquer l'aggravation de fobstruction bronchique souvent observ6e chez l'asthmatique lors des infections virales.certaines infections virales de l'enfant rsv et parainfluenza s'accompagnent de la production d'ige sp6cifiques anti-virus dont les taux sont proportionnels la s6vdrit6 de la maladie et au risque de d6velopper de l'asthme 19 la r6action entre certains virus respiratoires et leurs ige spdcifiques pourrait 4tre un m6canisme expliquant le r61e asthmog6ne de ces virus bien qu'il ne soit pas d6montr6 que ce conflit immunologique puisse causer la libdration de m6diateurs h partir des mastocytes ou des basophiles.les infections virales des voies respiratoires hautes exp4rimentales ou naturelles peuvent aggraver ou induire une hyperr6activit4 bronchique les m6canismes responsables de cette hyperr6activit4 sont mal connus et avanc6s principalement sur la base d'6tudes r6alis4es vitro ou chez l'animal les 16sions 4pith61iales pourraient favoriser la p4n4tration des allerghnes ces exp6riences d6montrent qu'une infection par rhinovirus peut chez l'homme allerglque aggraver l'hyperr6activit6 bronchique et amplifier la r6ponse imm6diate et retard6e apr6s inhalation d'un allerg6ne notamment h la faveur d'une augmentation de la lib6ration de m6diateurs mastocytaires et du recrutement d'6osinophiles dans les petites voies a6riennes des cytokines induites par l'infection virale dans les voies a6riennes pourraient favoriser la lib6ration de m6diateurs de l'allergie et l'activation des eosinophiles dans les bronches i1 est bien demontre vitro que l'infection de cellules inflammatoires par les rhinovirus s'accompagne d'une secretion accrue de cytokines capables d'amplifier ta reaction allergique de type 9 .frick et al 6 furent les premiers suggerer en 1977 une association entre infection virale respiratoire et l'apparition d'une sensibilisation reaginique chez l'enfant plusieurs etudes realisees chez l'animal d6montrent qu'une infection experimentale l'aide de differents virus respiratoires est capable d'amplifier la reponse immunologique /~ ige et la reaction allergique consecutive la readministration d'un antigene 16 chez l'enfant nous l'avons vu les infections `` vsr ou parainfluenza s'accompagnent de la production d'ige specifiques anti-virales et comportent un risque evident d'evolution uherieure vers l'asthme ou l'atopie 17 19 .classiquement les infections virales activent les lymphocytes ten privilegiant la production de cytokines th1 telles que l'interferon ifnt et l'interleukine 2 qui stimulent considerablement l'activite des macrophages des lymphocytes cytolytiques et des lymphocytes nk en vue d'eliminer le virus de l'organisme i1 est possible que certains virus puissent favoriser la sensibilisation reaginique ige-dependante en privilegiant la commutation des lymphocytes vers le type th2 et la secretion de cytokines proallergiques correspondantes il4 il5 peut egalement concevoir que les l~sions ~pitheliales provoquees par certains virus respiratoires puissent favoriser la retention et la penetration des allergenes la production d'ige et finalement la reaction allergique enfin certains virus cmv ebv hiv etc peuvent stimuler la production isotypique d'ige.la simple observation clinique suggere dej~ que les sujets atopiques souffrant de rhinite ou d'asthme sont plus sensibles aux infections virales et bacteriennes de l'organe de choc muqueuse nasale bronches les patients atteints de dermatite atopique sont tr~s sensibles certaines infections cutanees cette presomption clinique est parfaitement corroboree par les etudes epidemiologiques recentes les sujets allergiques souffrant de rhinite ou d'asthme et les enfants asthmatiques font des infections respiratoires hautes plus frequentes plus sev res et plus durables que les sujets non atopiques 10 14 15 .la plupart des etudes visant 5 mettre en evidence un deficit immunitaire chez les atopiques se sont soldees par un echec tout au plus certains travaux ont-ils montre un leger deficit de l'immunitd cellulaire chez certains patients tousles auteurs cependant s'accordent 5 reconnaitre chez les atopiques une diminution de la reponse des polynucleaires aux agents chimiotactiques l'absence de deficit immunitaire important chez les atopiques et le fait que la propension aux infections ne concerne que l'organe de choc conjonctives nez bronches peau sugg~re dej~ un trouble local des mecanismes de defense qui pourrait etre secondaire l'inflammation allergique chronique les mediateurs de l'anaphylaxie histamine leu-cotri~nes prostaglandines ... ont des effets varies hypersecretion muqueuse ralentissement de l'activite ciliaire contraction des muscles lisses augmentation de la permeabilite vasculaire pourant expliquer des ulcerations muqueuses un mauvais drainage des secretions une obstruction des voies aeriennes et/ou de l'ostium des cavites sinusales sinusite au cours de la reaction allergique les cellules epitheliales et endotheliales de la muqueuse respiratoire expriment la molecule d'adhesion icam-1 qui est le recepteur nature pour 90 p. cent des rhinovirus humains 8 .en outre l'exc~s de mucus pourrait entraver la migration et la capacite de phagocytose des macrophages et des polynucleaires i1 est donc logique de penser que chez l'asthmatique comme chez le bronchiteux chronique ce sont les lesions tissulaires secondaires /~ l'inflammation des bronches qui seraient le principal responsable de la propension de celles-ci aux infections l'aspergillose bronchopulmonaire allergique est un exemple demonstratif d'une infection pouvant compliquer l'atopie et qui est favorisee par la stagnation du mucus.une hypoth~se toute differente permettant d'expliquer la susceptibilite des atopiques aux infections de l'organe de choc serait l'existence d'une sensibilite anormale de leurs leucocytes toute une serie d'actions inhibitrices de l'histamine outre son action pro-inflammatoire bien connue et lice ~t la stimulation des recepteurs h1 et h2 des muscles lisses de l'endothelium caprilaire de l'epithelium bronchique et de certaines glandes l'histamine semble bien inhiber 5 des concentrations physiologiques diverses fonctions des leucocytes humains i1 est bien demontr6 vitro que l'histamine peut par un effet h2 inhiber une s4rie de fonctions des cellules inflammatoires telles que cytotoxicit6 prolif6ration des lymphocytes s6cr6tion de tnfc~ par les lymphocytes et les monocytes le chimiotactisme des polynu-cl6aires et leur s6cr6tion d'enzymes lysosomiales chez l'homme t'administration prudente d'histamine i.v inhibe pendant plusieurs heures la prolifdration des lymphocytes et la migration des polynucl6aires neutrophiles mesur6es ex vivo ce phdnom6ne n'est pas influenc6 par les anti-h1 mais il peut 4tre pr4venu par l'administration pr6alable de cim6tidine un anti-h2 2 3 .ces effets anti-inflammatoires de l'histamine pourraient avoir une importance clinique toute particuli6re chez les atopiques en effet les neutrophiles des patients atopiques sont anormalement sensibles fi l'action inhibitrice de l'histamine laquelle est par ailleurs lib6r6e en plus grande quantit4 que chez les sujets normaux i1 ne serait donc pas impossible que l'histamine un des principaux m6diateurs lib6r6s au si6ge des r4actions allergiques exerce par ses effets h2 anti-inflammatoires une action inhibitrice sur les lymphocytes et les polynucl6aires diminuant ainsi les m4canismes locaux de d6fense de l'organe de choc,dad represents non-specific pattern acute alveolar injury caused variety noxious agents 11 12 13

particularité de s'adresser à des sujets bien portants les principes actifs qui le composent sont issus d'organismes vivants et se différencient de ceux de la chimie classique par leurs structures moléculaires souvent complexes et parfois mal identifiées les propriétés de la préparation vaccinale dépendent étroitement du procédé de production mis en oeuvre et il est commun d'admettre que « le procédé fait le produit » la fabrication s'effectue en zones confinées due aux caractères pathogènes de la plupart des microorganismes impliqués les matières premières sont soumises à des contrôles rigoureux afin de garantir l'intégrité des produits vis-à-vis de contaminants viraux ou d'agents transmissibles non conventionnels comme le prion l'industrie du vaccin est caractérisée par la longueur des cycles de production la complexité des produits implique celle des contrôles qualité dont l'activité représente en moyenne 75 de la durée du cycle total de fabrication en tant qu'élément majeur de santé publique le monde du vaccin est soumis à des à-coups de production en fonction de la demande extérieure en particulier dans les contextes d'épidémie ou de menaces de bioterrorisme en parallèle l'industrie du vaccin doit intégrer les exigences toujours plus pressantes des autorités de santé le développement spectaculaire des départements assurance qualité et contrôle qualité ces quinze dernières années témoignent de cette évolution © 2009 elsevier masson sas tous droits réservés.le principe de la vaccination est d'induire chez l'individu sain la mémoire de plusieurs rencontres avec un agent infectieux en effet pour obtenir un niveau d'anticorps spécifiques capable de protéger l'individu la vaccination demande généralement plusieurs injections suivies de rappels.les premières approches d'immunisation remontent au vii e siècle où l'on reporte que des indiens bouddhistes ingéraient du venin de serpent pour se protéger des suites de morsures éventuelles 1 c'est au cours du xviii e siècle que les premiers bienfaits de la vaccination seront rapportés à travers les pratiques de « variolisation » déjà développées en inde et en chine puis introduites en angleterre par lady mary wortley montagu à son retour de turquie en 1721.\",\n",
       "  \"visant à qualifier un vaccin contre les rotavirus ont nécessité le recrutement de 70 000 enfants pour un coût de 150 millions de dollars sur cette seule étude.se rajoute aux coûts d'études cliniques la prise en compte de l'unité de production englobant outre le bâtiment lui-même ses équipements ses utilités et toutes les procédures de qualification et de validation qui doivent se conformer aux exigences des bonnes pratiques de fabrication cgmp pour les états-unis à noter que l'europe et l'oms disposent aussi de gmp qui ne sont pas strictement identiques ni entre elles ni avec celles de la fda.il faut prévoir un montant compris entre 100 et 200 millions pour la mise à disposition d'un bâtiment validé et fonctionnel et une durée de quatre à six ans depuis l'avant projet jusqu à la mise sur le marché des premières doses.les progrès de la biologie moléculaire ont donné naissance à de nouveaux types de vaccins dont l'antigène n'est plus produit par l'organisme pathogène les exemples du vaccin hépatite b exprimé dans les cellules cho ou dans la levure de boulangerie ou plus récemment celui de l'antigène du papillomavirus exprimé dans la levure ou dans des cellules d'insecte témoignent du souci d'isoler et purifier le principe actif conduisant à des vaccins mieux caractérisés et mieux tolérés.la capacité de certains virus à induire une forte réponse immunitaire est mise à profit pour leur faire exprimer des protéines étrangères c'est l'exemple du vaccin contre la dengue qui est en cours de développement et dont les antigènes sont exprimés par le virus de la fièvre jaune ou l'exemple de la famille des poxviridae utilisant un poxvirus du canari pour exprimer des protéines hétérologues vih par exemple .le vaccin idéal vise à protéger contre le plus grand nombre de maladies en une seule injection qui soit la moins douloureuse possible et ne présente aucun effet indésirable toute une série d'initiatives visent à se rapprocher de cet objectif mise sur le marché de vaccins combinés formes plus purifiées et réduites à la molécule du principe actif développement de nouvelles techniques d'administration vaccinales pour remplacer l'aiguille systèmes de patch .le besoin de sécurité imposé par les agences vise à obtenir un produit mieux caractérisé fabriqué à partir d'un procédé parfaitement maîtrisé et documenté pour cela des outils de caractérisation aussi résolutifs que la résonance magnétique nucléaire rmn sont devenus des éléments courants pour appuyer le développement de nouveaux vaccins ou pour argumenter la biocomparabilité entre deux produits ayant subi des changements de procédés de production d'autres pratiques continuent à se déployer comme l'utilisation de contenants et même de bioréacteurs à usage unique afin de répondre aux préoccupations traditionnelles liées à la validation du nettoyage.l'amélioration des sondes et des capteurs couplée à des outils informatiques plus performants permettent l'acquisition des données mais aussi le contrôle et la modélisation du procédé avec l'espoir à long terme d'évaluer la conformité du produit en se basant sur l'acquisition exhaustive des données de culture en ligne process analytical technology 9 .de par ses spécificités l'accès au marché du vaccin n'est pas simple et fait réfléchir un grand nombre de sociétés face à l'investissement financier au temps de mise en route demandé et aux contraintes réglementaires toujours plus présentes au contraire des produits de la pharmacie traditionnelle le vaccin n'est pas dans la tourmente des produits génériques sa fabrication nécessite un large savoir-faire le procédé fait le produit et il est indispensable de posséder les bonnes lignées cellulaires et les isolats viraux ou bactériens prélevés initialement sur des échantillons humains.après les formidables progrès réalisés au cours des deux siècles passés la mise à l'échelle industrielle de la production de vaccins permet de sauver chaque année plus de trois millions de vies humaines 5 les pays industrialisés ont bénéficié avant tout de ces progrès et ont vu disparaître progressivement des affections comme la rage le tétanos la diphtérie ou la polio pour n'en citer que quelques-unes.cela ne doit pas nous faire oublier qu'il reste encore de nombreux défis à relever dans les années à venir les grands groupes pharmaceutiques investissent pour soutenir un doublement de leur capacité de production d'ici 2012-2015 et doivent s'aligner continuellement sur les recommandations de l'oms pour participer aux campagnes de vaccination en liaison avec les autorités de santé et les experts l'arrivée de groupes tel que global alliance vaccines immunization gavi largement financé par la fondation bill et melinda gates apporte des sources de financement importantes 750 millions de dollars en 2005 pour permettre la vaccination des enfants dans les pays les plus démunis et pour investir dans la recherche de vaccins contre les maladies tropicales dengue paludisme 10 ces financements constituent un moteur important dans les stratégies de recherches des grandes compagnies pharmaceutiques des résultats significatifs d'une telle approche ont déjà été obtenus dans la lutte contre la fièvre jaune en afrique les pays industrialisés sous l'égide de l'oms apportent également un soutien important pour permettre le transfert de technologie pour la production du vaccin grippe afin de se préparer à la lutte contre une éventuelle pandémie 11 les informations publiées par l'industrie pharmaceutique ces derniers mois révèlent des progrès spectaculaires dans la production de ce vaccin grâce à l'emploi de nouveaux adjuvants qui permettent une augmentation de capacité d'un facteur 6.beaucoup de pays d'asie ont fait d'immenses progrès et sont devenus des producteurs importants non seulement locaux mais également internationaux après l'obtention de la certification de l'oms label qui garanti la qualité des produits répondants aux normes internationales publiées par cet organisme à titre d'exemple l'inde est devenue le principal producteur de vaccin contre la rougeole et un acteur majeur de la production des vaccins rentrant dans le programme élargi de vaccination la chine s'apprête à participer à cet effort de production pour son marché local et pour l'exportation notamment vis-à-vis d'un vaccin contre
